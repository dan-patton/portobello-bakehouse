There are *plenty* of reasons to celebrate a fresh loaf as you will discover.

* Terry Tiger created the eponymous Tiger Bread, so called due to the resemblance of his horrendous psoriasis
* James Farmhouse made a lovely box-like loaf that could provide shelter to mice or hampsters upon careful hollowing
* Celebrities **love** bread. Most of them anyway
* Stick some butter and jam on for a delicious snack

You can't go wrong unless you get one of those american pre-sliced sweet bread things
