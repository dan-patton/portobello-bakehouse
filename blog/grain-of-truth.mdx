You need to make a good firm cut across the top of a risen loaf before the bake

An unslashed loaf will explode under the hot pressure, like a potato in a micowave or a chihuahua under normal circumstances

**You must not carve ancient curses into your loaf.**

**This is a social faux pas. Use new curses.**
