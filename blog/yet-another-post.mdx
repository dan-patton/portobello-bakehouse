Ideas for a breakfast:

1. Butter and Marmalade on a slice of fresh bread
2. Butter and Marmite on fresh bread, but not really - just stick to a nice jam instead of marmite, mate
3. Butter on a thick slice of toast. Really melt it on there, mate

**That's for starters**

You can pretty much stick anything on that toast and pair it up with a fresh brew of your choosing
